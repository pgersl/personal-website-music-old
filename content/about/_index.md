# About Me

Hello! My name is Petr Geršl, born 2005. I am an amateur composer.

I started composing when I was 15 and I had some time on my hands. This started with improvisation on the piano and showing the results to my friend - [Vít Černý](https://vitcerny.xyz/). He asked me an important question then: *Why don't you write it down?* And that was my starting point. Vítek has been giving me useful feedback on my compositions ever since and we even worked on a piece together.

My early compositions were bad and only a few survived. These compositions were written mainly for solo piano and I called them sonatas (not to be confused with the new Sonatas, which you find in the [Compositions](/compositions/) list). They were hardly playable, very repetitive and not at all written in sonata form. The style was also very similar to that of [Philip Glass](https://philipglass.com/).

After these early mishaps, I continued working on some more solo piano pieces in the style of Philip Glass. Later, I tried to compose for some untraditional ensembles, collections of synths, strings and percussion. I composed a few pieces in the style of [Steve Reich](https://stevereich.com/).

I started composing for traditional ensembles recently and deviated from the style of Glass and Reich. I am growing more and more fond of the style of [Arvo Pärt](https://www.arvopart.ee/en/arvo-part/) and I am most definitely going to explore it further in the future. I also explored the late romantic period style in my latest pieces.

I am mostly self-taught in musical composition and music theory. I attended an elementary school of arts but dropped out because I did not find attending it meaningful to me anymore. This was happening at the same time as I was starting with composition.

# About the Music, You Can Find Here

I am an amateur composer and I don't have enough money or know-how to record my pieces. This is why the recordings you can find here are simply audio exports from the program they were written in - [Musescore](https://musescore.org/). The recent updates to the program have enabled me to create some very realistic recordings that can give you almost the full experience of an actual recording.

Hopefully, this will not be the case in the future.

# About This Site

This site was created in the summer of 2023 as a part of a larger web development project of mine, which was redesigning my old website and creating several new ones for easier content management (read more in [this article](https://pgersl.xyz/articles/big-changes-coming/)).

The site's design is minimal in nature so your focus is on the music and not everything around it. It employs some lightweight javascript which I coded all by myself and learned a lot by doing it.

The code for this site is open source and can be found [here]().
