# Notes

Works for Piano is my first online collection for solo piano. It contains some of my first written compositions, composed primarily in 2021. This was the year I started composing.

Compositions Nos. 1 - 10 are a sort of introductory cycle to my early composition. Their lengths vary from less than a minute to almost ten minutes. Some of them might be considered radically reductionistic, Composition No. 2 for example is based on just one harmonic movement repeating in different keys. They are all based on The Piano Ã‰tudes by Philip Glass and inspiration can be seen throughout these.

Compositions Nos. 11 - 15 are based on the same harmonic movement: i - VI - III - V. Philip Glass uses it in many of his pieces including several of his symphonies, most notably his Tirol Concerto (Piano Concerto No. 1). I tried to write pieces solely based on this chord progression to see how much can be done with a rather simple idea.

Piano Sonata No. 1 is a piece in three movements with traditional tempos (fast - slow - fast). A chromatic and mode-changing harmonic progression was devised as the main idea of the piece. The Sonata doesn't follow any formal rules of sonata writing, no themes are developed, because no real melody is present.

Have a good listen!
