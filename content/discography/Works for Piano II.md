# Notes

Works for Piano II is the second online collection for solo piano. It contains some of my newer pieces composed primarily in 2022.

Compositions Nos. 16 - 18 are a continuation of my clich√© cadence experiments. They are also the last ones to use this harmonic progression as their foundation. Compositions Nos. 19 - 25 are a sort of a farewell to solo piano composition for me as at the time of writing Composition No. 25, I knew I would not return to this kind of composition for a while.

Piano Sonata No. 2 is one of my longest pieces, lasting for well over an hour. It uses some more traditional harmonic progressions, and it is very repetitive and meditative in a sense since its primarily slow tempo makes you fall into a different state of thinking. Some of it could be used as ambient music.

Enjoy the listening!
