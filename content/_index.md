My name is Petr Geršl (b. 2005). I am an amateur composer. In my works, I try to explore the myriad of different styles of classical music that speak to me. This includes some of the newest pieces written, notably the oeuvre of Philip Glass and Steve Reich, and older masterworks, namely Richard Strauss, Richard Wagner or Dmitri Shostakovich.

My opus is not great nor insignificant. I have completed a collection of solo piano pieces, written several contemporary pieces for various ensembles, 3 symphonies in various styles and a number of pieces for orchestra and soloists.

I am mostly self-taught in musical composition, mainly by reading orchestral scores and playing the piano.
