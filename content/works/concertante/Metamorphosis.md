# Program note

Metamorphosis is a piece for a string orchestra and four solo violins. It is written in five movements, each inspired by a minimalist composer I like. Nos. 1 and 5 are written in the style of some pieces by Arvo Pärt, Nos. 2 and 4 are written in the style of Steve Reich and No. 3 is written in the style of Michael Gordon.

Metamorphosis is a compilation of several ideas that were in my head. At first, I did not intend to combine them all into a single piece, however, after I wrote them, the thought did not seem as alien.

The name *Metamorphosis* did not carry any symbolic meaning at the time this piece was written. I simply liked the sound of it and was inspired by Glass' cycle for solo piano, which is also scored in five movements and cyclical in composition. Today, however, Metamorphosis carries a special meaning to my musical thinking. It is the first piece for a traditional ensemble I have ever written and I have not returned to the styles of composition I used to write since. It is a metamorphosis of my own style.
