# Program notes

Music for Piano and Strings is a piece for piano and string orchestra. I originally called it *Piano Concerto No. 1* but I later realized it was not worthy of such a title.

The piece is written in three movements and is again a compilation of several works that I worked on earlier. Movement I was originally a string sextet, but I never finished it. When an idea for a piece for piano and strings got to me, I picked it up, rewrote it for string orchestra and added a piano part. Movement II was originally written as a piece for a school mass and was meant to be played during the reception of the body of Christ. The piece was performed but I had to strip it of many parts and it was incoherent in the end. I took it and finished it second. Movement III is the only one written solely for this piece.

Movement III is also harmonically most interesting featuring interesting dissonances. The coda of the movement is based on the harmonic progression of Movement II. It sounds almost romantic and is a sort of prelude to what I have written afterward.
