# Program note

Mallet Counterpoint is a rewrite of an unpublished piece of mine which I called *Four Pianists* written in 2022. It was originally written for four pianos, but I decided to repurpose it for a percussion ensemble. The original piece was also much shorter and I doubled its length during the rewrite. The melody is in the characteristic Steve Reich rhythm 3-2-1-2 from many of his pieces, most clearly audible in his *Clapping Music*.
