# Program note

Keyboard Quartet is a piece in the style of Steve Reich with much less harmonic movement than most pieces of his.

The piece is scored for four keyboards which in theory can be whichever sound the performer finds most suitable. In the recording here, the first three parts are some type of an electric piano and the fourth part is an electric organ.

Keyboard Quartet is divided into three movements - Fast - Slow - Fast. They are played without a pause one after the other In the fast movements, the second and third keyboards sustain mainly the rhythm, while the first and fourth keyboards provide repetitive motivic material. The slow movement is a counterpoint of all the keyboards together. 

# Rewrites

Keyboard Quartet was only very slightly edited at the start of 2024 regarding the instrumentation. It was originally scored for three keyboards and celesta. The celesta was changed to another keyboard.
