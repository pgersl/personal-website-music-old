# Program note

Piano Counterpoint No. 2 (similar to [Piano Counterpoint No. 1](/works/chamber/piano-counterpoint-no.-1)) was originally part of an early cycle that I called *Four Instruments*. The cycle was originally supposed to have five movements, the first four introducing the *four instruments* in question - organ, piano, marimba and cello, and the fifth was supposed to be a combination of the four instruments. Only the first four movements were composed and the piece was then abandoned and I never returned to it. The other parts were too simple even for me and unpleasant to listen to.

The whole counterpoint has no harmonic motion aided by the constant pulse of the third piano throughout the piece. It is scored for three pianos. The piece is in C major/ A minor, but it moves more around a dominant sound of G major with a combination of D minor.
