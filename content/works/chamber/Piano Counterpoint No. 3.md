# Program note

Piano Counterpoint No. 3 is the first of my piano counterpoints to be originally called a piano counterpoint.

The harmony of the piece is largely based on John Adams' piece for two pianos called *Hallelujah Junction*. I fell in love with it the moment I heard it for the first time and I had to write a piece like that myself.

Just like Hallelujah Junction, my composition uses the exciting sound of pianos playing (mostly) the same patterns in different ranges a few notes apart. Three pianos do exactly this in my piece legato and con pedale. The fourth piano provides a stronger sense of rhythm in its staccato arpeggios.
