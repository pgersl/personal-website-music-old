# Program note

Music for Mallet Instruments is a counterpoint for four percussionists in the style of Steve Reich. The four players switch between glockenspiels, marimbas, vibes and xylophones.

The piece changes harmony each time the players switch instruments.

# Rewrites

The piece was initially supposed to be in three movements, but it was abandoned before that was finished. The piece was edited at the start of 2024 to accommodate this. Otherwise, nothing was changed.
