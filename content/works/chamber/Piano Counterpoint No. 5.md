# Program note

Piano Counterpoint No. 5 was originally called just *Wednesday Afternoon* since the idea for it was conceived on a Wednesday afternoon. We used to jam with my friend [Vít Černý](https://vitcerny.xyz) after school. He came to me with an idea for harmony on one of these afternoons and we tried to come up with something on top of it. We got started with the rhythm. We found a groovy one that we liked. He played what is now the first piano in the score and I improvised some motives on top of it. I then added even more voices when I was writing the piece down and a four-piano piece was written.

I like this piece very much and it is my favorite piano counterpoint. I like the rhythm, I like the harmony. It is close to perfect and I could listen to it on repeat for hours.
