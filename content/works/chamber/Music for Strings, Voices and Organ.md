# Program note

Music for Strings, Voices and Organ is a piece written originally for a school orchestra to be performed as a postlude to a mass, however, it was deemed too long and boring to be played. Hurt but unbroken, I have decided to make it even longer and change the mood completely. The piece was originally quite hopeful and only 20 minutes long. I tripled the length and changed the mood to something more aggressive. 

The piece has several parts which repeat many times. It is scored for two violins and cellos, a solo organ and a SATB choir. Most of the piece is only solo organ with the strings only playing in the beginning and a handful of times later. The choir is featured about the same as the strings. In the last third, however, the calm and hopeful mood of the piece changes to aggressive strings playing with the organ with the choir singing an almost operatic scene.

The choir sings without text.
