*Composition No. 6* is one of the most melancholic pieces I have written so far. It is full of emotion, but it also contains fragments of melody, which perhaps indicates a development of me as a composer, going from robotic pieces to more human ones.  

# Program note

Composition No. 6 is written in F minor, it can be divided into three sections - introduction and theme, transition, and climax. The introduction, though repetitive, shows fragments of a melody. This melody is composed of short, no more than two bars long, motives that always point to a diatonic note, usually the root, other triadic notes, or a leading note. 

The transition section consists of two sections. In the first one, only one note per chord in accompaniment is repeated in sextuplets in a bar, in the second section high trills are played and the tension rises. Since the repeated notes in the first section are played in sextuplet, they set up an illusion of a faster tempo. This then causes a sudden feeling of suspense as the trills enter, since the accompaniment appears to suddenly slow down.

Finally, the climax is a chord progression played on the entire range of the piano. It looks like this: F<sup>m</sup> - E&#9837;<sup>6</sup> - D&#9837;<sup>6</sup> - D&#9837;<sup>dim7</sup>. Although this progression is heard throughout the whole piece, it is never so clearly pronounced and strong. The piece ends on a ritardando.
