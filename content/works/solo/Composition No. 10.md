*Composition No. 10* is an experiment with Erik Satie's style. Overall, it is still very minimalistic and repetitive but also very different from other pieces of mine thus far.

# Program note

Composition No. 10 has a similar structure to *Gymnop√©die No. 1* by Erik Satie. A chord progression is pronounced without a melody, and with a melody afterward. This happens three times in the composition, each section is repeated. The harmony is close to atonal, there is no clear key center and the harmony moves in unpredictable directions. However, one gets used to this ambiguity via repetition. The tempo of this piece is very slow and the dynamics are unpredictable, almost random at times. The entire piece repeats before the last chord enters.

# Rewrites

Composition No. 10 was never rewritten or modified.
