# Program note

Composition No. 25 is the last of my solo piano pieces for a while. It is based on Glass' *Closing* of the soundtrack to the film *Mishima*. It is a sort of farewell to this style of musical composition and my sign to move on to other forms and ensembles. It uses some very simple harmony, only fragments of melody and a constant tempo. Of all of my piano compositions, this one has to be my favorite. Somehow, this composition manages to incorporate many of my emotions and listening to it as I write this analysis almost makes me cry.

I do not know why this composition has such an emotional impact on me, I never intended it to have any on anyone, the same applies to my other piano pieces. They were never intended to be emotional or encapturing any deeper meaning, this one however somehow does it for me. It only proves me right in my thinking that art is not exclusively about the artist.
