# Program note

Composition No. 20 is directly inspired by Glass' *Mad Rush*. Also similar in length, both Mad Rush and Composition No. 20 utilize a polyrhythm (3:2) as the main moving force. Unlike Mad Rush, however, the differences in tempo and dynamics are not as varied in my piece. Both pieces are written primarily in the F major (or a minor) with some variation.
