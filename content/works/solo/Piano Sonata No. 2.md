# Program note

Piano Sonata No. 2 is one of my longest pieces yet. It lasts well over an hour. Movements I, III and IV are written in a slow tempo, Movement II is paced faster.

All movements of this sonata are very repetitive and they do not follow any strict form. The 3:2 polyrhythm is used throughout the piece. The harmony of the movements does not strictly follow the modern minimalist atonality and features some satisfying resolutions.
