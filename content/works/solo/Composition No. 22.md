# Program note

Composition No. 22 is based on the well-known melody of the Gregorian chant - *Dies Irae*. There is nothing deeper, the piece is not about faith or death or anything else, I just liked the melody and came up with a context for it. The piece is quite long and is similar in structure to Glass' Ã‰tude No. 1 in that the sections themselves repeat with slight variations. The piece also has a long Coda, where the main idea changes.
