Your support is greatly appreciated. If you do find my music interesting and worthwhile, you can show your support via different means.

# Listening {{< icon-link href="https://audio.com/petr-gersl" target="_blank" icon="fa-solid fa-record-vinyl" >}}

By simply listening to my music, you are fulfilling its purpose. Otherwise, what is the purpose of music nobody listens to?

# Sharing

By sharing my music anywhere you think is appropriate, you are getting my name out there and giving me countless opportunities for further compositional development. Thank you!

# Purchasing {{< icon-link href="https://pgersl.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" icon="fa-brands fa-bandcamp" >}}

You can support me financially by purchasing my music on Bandcamp. You can find all my tracks there (exported from Musescore) and support me and Bandcamp by buying them. This way you not only help me grow my financial independence, but you are also supporting a platform for creators like me and many others. Thank you very much!

# Donating {{< icon-link href="https://paypal.me/petrgersl" target="_blank" icon="fa-brands fa-paypal" >}}

If you only want to support me financially, you may do so through personal donations using your PayPal account. Donations of any size are greatly appreciated.
